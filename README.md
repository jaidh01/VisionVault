# VisionVault
A project that uses an ESP32-CAM mounted on goggles to stream live video, allowing users to capture images with a keystroke. Images are processed via the Gemmini Vision API to generate detailed descriptions, creating a virtual memory bank. Hands-free and innovative, it redefines how we capture moments.
